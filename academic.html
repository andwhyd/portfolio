                <p class="lead mb-4"><span class="text-primary">January 2020 - Present</span></p>
                <p class="lead">I currently serve as the robotic arm lead for the Boiler Robotics Club. My group is
                  focused on the design and production of a robot arm capable of completing various
                  tasks at the annual <a href="http://urc.marssociety.org/" target="_blank">University
                    Rover Challenge</a>. Being a new team, my team has had the unique opportunity to
                  build our arm from the ground up.
                </p>
                <h4 class="mb-2">Requirements</h4>
                <p class="lead">Being a new team, our primary focus was on determining the design parameters for our
                  arm. After reviewing previous competitions and the game manual for 2020, our
                  team came up with the following requirements:
                <ul>
                  <li>1 meter reach and ability to grab from the ground</li>
                  <li>5kg payload capacity</li>
                  <li>5mm movement accuracy at max extension</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h4 class="mb-2">Current Status</h4>
                <p class="lead">The fall 2020 semester focused on completing the CAD design for our robot arm,
                  working on the previous semester's research and testing. We have settled on a SCARA
                  style arm that allows our arm to easily reach different positions in all 6 axes. Due
                  to limited software experience, we decided on this SCARA style to limit the control
                  complexity. We also believe this platform gives us the most stability compared to
                  traditional 6 or 7 axis arms. Our CAD model continues to increase in detail,
                  allowing us to ensure all components integrate well and perform analysis on the
                  strength of the arm and its ability to complete the required missions.
                </p>
                <h4 class="mb-2">Personal Contibutions</h4>
                <p class="lead">On the logistical side, my contributions have included scheduling meetings and other
                  housekeeping tasks. I am responsible for maintaining our bill of materials as well
                  as ordering and distributing parts. The restrictions from COVID-19 this semester
                  also lead to me looking into various ways to ensure my team was fully engaged and
                  contributing. By setting consistent and reasonable goals for each team member and
                  regularly checking in on them, team members were always able to contribute to the
                  design throughout the semester despite being unable to meet in person. Hosting
                  weekly meetings and recording the progress made each week allowed us to review our
                  progress over the semester and find areas we could improve as well.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">On the technical side, I focused on the design of our gantry lift system for the
                  Z-axis of the arm as well as the software stack needed to control our arm. For the
                  gantry lift, my design focused on using a reliable leadscrew drive that prevented
                  accidental backdriving. The custom carriage and bearing assembly ensured smooth
                  travel as well as protection from outside elements during traversal. For software
                  control, the team decided on using the ROS MoveIt package for control. This software
                  package was well documented and commonly used in many industries. My main focus was
                  adapting our model of the arm to work with the URDF format required by the software,
                  as well as preparing a simulated environment via Gazebo to allow us to test our
                  controls and software in conjunction with the manufacturing of our arm. In addition
                  due
                  to my experience with manufacturing, I worked to waterjet and mill parts towards the
                  end of the semester and prepare for assembly starting in Spring 2021.

                <p class="lead">The MOBI team focuses on the development of technology to assist in human mobility.
                  Projects of this team have included interactive campus maps for those with
                  disabilities and custom baseballs to allow visually impaired athletes to enjoy
                  baseball as well.
                </p>
                <h4 class="mb-2">Robbins</h4>
                <p class="lead">The aim of the Robbins project is to build an exam step for use during sonographic
                  leg mapping that reduces strain in the lumbar spine and brachial joint in the
                  sonographers and allows patients to be comfortable for the duration of the
                  procedure. For the duration of the project, the team was partnered with IU Health
                  Arnett's Radiology & Imaging department located in the Greater Lafayette area. The
                  mission of the healthcare system is to improve the health of patients and the
                  community through innovation, and excellence in care, education, research, and
                  service.

                <h4 class="mb-2">Personal Contributions</h4>
                <p class="lead">Working with our project partner, I led my team of four in designing and
                  manufacturing the stand. I used my skills in Solidworks to model our prototype and
                  we manufactured and presented our improved stand in March 2020. Due to a lack of
                  advanced manufacturing capabilities, the design had to be constructed using basic
                  shop tools, while still meeting all requirements for safety and appearances. In
                  addition to the design of the stand, I also implemented the testing procedures for
                  our stand. EPICS also helped strengthen many of my soft skills as I worked to
                  implement client feedback and meet tight deadlines.

                <p class="lead">Dedicated to fostering a passion in science and technology within our community, the
                  Monta Vista Robotics Team inspires students and develops interpersonal skills
                  through team-based engineering challenges. Competing in the <a
                    href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics
                    Challenge</a>, MVRT was founded in 1997 and has taken great strides in
                  technology and leadership by encouraging its members to further pursue their
                  imaginations and introducing many students to the exciting and expansive world of
                  engineering and STEM.</p>
                <h4 class="mb-2">President</h4>
                <p class="lead">Elected as President my senior year of high school, I worked to lead the team through
                  the 2019 season. While still involved with some design and manufacturing of the
                  robot, as President my goals shifted to preparing incoming members and ensuring all
                  MVRT members had an exciting and educational experience. Facing a knowledge gap due
                  to a smaller upperclassmen group, I coordinated with the others to create impactful
                  workshops that allowed our incoming freshman and rising sophomores to participate
                  more throughout the season than ever before. The rapid six week build season for
                  this competition gave me my first real experience as a leader. Though I would have
                  preferred a flawless season, looking back I am grateful for the opportunity to lead
                  and have found many of the lessons learned applicable in college and hopefully the
                  years to come as well.

                <h4 class="mb-2">Design</h4>
                <p class="lead">The Monta Vista Robotics Club gave me my first taste of mechanical engineering and I
                  was instantly hooked. Watching my designs and creations come to life has always been
                  extremely satisfying and one of the main reasons I am studying mechanical
                  engineering. Through MVRT I learned to use CAD and CAM software, as well as many
                  different manufacturing techniques. The skills I picked up in high school have
                  allowed me to immediately contribute to many of my college activities.</p>
